> This is a Github Container Port for [OpenTTD with JGRennison's patches](https://github.com/JGRennison/OpenTTD-patches) based on https://github.com/bateau84/openttd. Parts of this readme have only been altered slighty, things may be broken. The Kubernetes section below has been adapted but remains untested.

## Usage

### File locations

This image is supplied with a user named `openttd`.  
Openttd server is run as this user and subsequently its home folder will be `/home/openttd`.  
OpenTTD on linux uses `.local/share/openttd` in users' home folder to store configurations, save files and other miscellaneous game files.  
If you want to make your local files accessible to openttd server inside the container you need to mount them inside with `-v` parameter (see https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/ for more details on -v)

### Environment variables

These environment variables can be altered to change the behavior of the application inside the container.  
To assign a new value to an enviroment variable use docker's `-e ` parameter (see https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/ for more details)

| Env var  | Default value   | States & Descriptions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Networking

By default docker does not expose the containers on your network. This must be done manually with `-p` parameter (see [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) for more details on -p).
If your openttd config is set up to listen on port 3979 you need to map the container port to your machine's network like so `-p 3979:3979` where the first reference is the host machine's port and the second the container's port on the internal Docker network to which it is joined.

### Examples

Run OpenTTD and expose the default ports.

    docker run -d -p 3979:3979/tcp -p 3979:3979/udp ghcr.io/ghostlydilemma/openttd-jgrpp:latest

Run Openttd with a random port assignment.

    docker run -d -P ghcr.io/ghostlydilemma/openttd-jgrpp:latest

Its set up to not load any games by default (new game) and it can be run without mounting a .openttd folder.  
However, if you want to save/load your games, mounting a .openttd folder is required.

    docker run -v /path/to/your/.openttd:/home/openttd/.local/share/openttd/ -p 3979:3979/tcp -p 3979:3979/udp ghcr.io/ghostlydilemma/openttd-jgrpp:latest

Set UID and GID of user in container to be the same as your user outside with setting env PUID and PGID.
For example

    docker run -e PUID=1000 -e PGID=1000 -v /path/to/your/.openttd:/home/openttd/.local/share/openttd/ -p 3979:3979/tcp -p 3979:3979/udp ghcr.io/ghostlydilemma/openttd-jgrpp:latest

For other save games use (/home/openttd/.openttd/save/ is appended to savename when passed to openttd command)

    docker run -e "loadgame=true" -e "savename=game.sav" -v /path/to/your/.openttd:/home/openttd/.local/share/openttd/ -p 3979:3979/tcp -p 3979:3979/udp ghcr.io/ghostlydilemma/openttd-jgrpp:latest

For example to run server and load my savename game.sav:

    docker run -d -p 3979:3979/tcp -p 3979:3979/udp -v /home/<your_username>/.openttd:/home/openttd/.local/share/openttd/ -e PUID=<your_userid> -e PGID=<your_groupid> -e "loadgame=true" -e "savename=game.sav" ghcr.io/ghostlydilemma/openttd-jgrpp:latest

## Docker Compose

The preferred way is to use this image with Docker Compose. Following is an example configuration in use for my own OpenTTD server:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  openttd:
    # Use the "latest" tag to get most recent version of jgr's patch pack
    image: ghcr.io/ghostlydilemma/openttd-jgrpp:54.4
    ports:
      - "3979:3979/tcp"
      - "3979:3979/udp"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/home/openttd/.local/share/openttd/
    restart: always
    environment:
      PUID: "1003"
      PGID: "1004"
      loadgame: last-autosave

  console:
    image: golang
    command: sleep infinity
```

You can copy the above into a file, or use the pre-built parameterized docker-compose.yaml file in this repo's root directory. After copying and editing a sample environment file appropriate for your docker host and renaming it to .env, you can launch a stack in no time by running ``docker-compose up``.

If you are trying to host a container on Windows, and your OpenTTD config filepath contains spaces, you can reference it like below:

```
"//c/Users/username/directory with space/OpenTTD:/home/openttd/.local/share/openttd/"
```

Your savegame filename must not contain any spaces.

## Kubernetes (untested)

> The following Kubernetes section has been taken from bateau84/openttd. As I don't use this approach this remains untested. It should be adapted to the changes added here but I can't say for certain

Supplied some example for deploying on kubernetes cluster. "UNTESTED_k8s_openttd.yml"
just run

    kubectl apply openttd.yaml

and it will apply configmap with openttd.cfg, deployment and service listening on port 31979 UDP/TCP.
